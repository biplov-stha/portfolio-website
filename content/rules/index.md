## Rules to consider:
1. More priority will be given to the blogs related to `technology`, `review of tech hardware and software`, `digital privacy`, `software development`, etc.
1. Define your blog title as, **Blog on "your blog title goes here"**.
1. Attach the necessary files, like the blog itself and photos (if any).
1. Blog must be written in **markdown** format.

### Markdown? What's that?
- Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.
Details 
[here](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started).
- Markdown file has **.md** extension.
- Why [Markdown?](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started#why-use-markdown), because it's portable, platform independent, can be used to write blog like this one.

### Where can I write then?
- Best way to get started is to use online markdown editors like [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) and [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/app#).
- You can also use [makereadme](https://www.makeareadme.com/) and [readme.so](https://readme.so/editor) but these are specifically designed to create README.md file for github.
- If you don't want to use online editor then you can use various applications, details [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started#documents).
